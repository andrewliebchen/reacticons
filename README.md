# What are Reacticons?

Reacticons are scalable file icons for ReactJS. They're hip, cute, customizeable, and (can be) animated.

## Using Reacticons in your project

First, of course, you need to `require` Reacticons.

```
var Reacticon = require('path/to/reacticon');
```

Boom, now you can use Reacticons where ever you want!

```
<Reacticon
  height="100"
  primaryColor="#2ECC40"
  type="table"
  label="xlxs"
  animate />
```

### Available `props`
Reacticons have quite a few `props` that can help you customize the appearance and behavior of the icons.

##### `width`
Type: String

##### `height`
Type: String
You'll need to define a `width` or a `height`, otherwise you won't be able to see your lovely new icon!

##### `type`
Type: String. One of 'text', 'table', 'image', 'code', 'slides'
Required. Defines the file type icon within the file icon.

##### `label`
Type: String
This is intended to be the file extension of the file represented by the icon. For example, `doc`, `xlsx`, `html`.

##### `bgColor`
Type: String
Default: `#fff`. Accepts a valid CSS color. Defines the color of the file image. The fold-over flap is derived from the main background color.

##### `primaryColor`
Type: String
Default: `#0074d9`. Accepts a valid CSS color. The file type icon is monochromatic. You can define the base color for this icon.

##### `strokeColor`
Type: String
Accepts a valid CSS color to draw a 1px border around the icon background.

##### `animate`
Type: Boolean
The file type icons can have cute little animations.

##### `progress`
Type: String
If there is a value for this `prop`, a progress bar will replace the label.

##### `isProcessing`
Type: Boolean
Should the progress bar have a loading indicator style? If `progress` is not defined, the progress bar will be "processing" at 100%.

## Why is this useful?

Commonly, modern web applications make use of image sprite- or font-based icons. Font-based icons work particularly well because they're inheriently vector-based, however there are plenty of limitations. Here are two: icons can be difficult to animate and they're limited to only one color (unless you want to do some multi-icon layout gymnastics).

ReactJS makes it really easy to manage `SVG`s and include configurable `SVG`-based components in your project. Reacticons are `SVG` file icons that can be easily included in your project and colored, scaled, progress-bared and animated.
